# SkiMatch

SkiMatch is a web application created at the University of Virginia and designed for use by members of the UVA community. Our platform allows students and faculty to connect over shared skills, interests, experiences and expertise. Users can create profiles that list their relevant academic information (i.e. major, past courses, UVA email, etc.) and skills, along with an explanation of why they are using the app (i.e. to find/provide tutoring, form study groups, or find community members with similar hobbies and interests).

## Getting Started

These instructions will detail how to set up your SkiMatch account and start connecting with other users.

### Initial Login

Go to https://skillbuilder.herokuapp.com and select "Sign in with Google" to create an account. Select your @virginia.edu email address and enter your UVA login information.

### Creating Your Profile

1. Fill out the first three fields (name, year, and major) and whichever other fields you would like to complete.
2. Use the Bio section to share the personal information and past experiences relevant to your skills profile. 
3. Create a status that explains how you intend to use SkiMatch (i.e. "Looking to form a CS2150 study group").
4. Click the "Publish" button to make your profile visible to other users.

### Viewing Other Users

#### Searching
Use the search bar in the top right corner of the screen to find other users by name or skill. Click the "View all" option to see a list of all registered users.

#### Endorsing
When viewing another user's profile, you can endorse one or more of their skills by clicking the thumbs up button next to each one. By endorsing someone's skill, you let other users know the person is proficient in that skill. 

*To return to your own profile, click the "Profile" tab on the navigation bar at the top of the screen.* 

### Updating Your Profile

If you wish to make additions or changes to your profile page, click the "Update Profile" tab on the navigation bar. This will redirect you to a form for adding to or editing the fields you initially filled out when creating your profile. Once you have finished making edits, click the "Publish" button to save your changes.

### Logging Out

Click the "Log Out" button on the navigation bar to leave the site. If you wish to log in again later, return to https://skillbuilder.herokuapp.com and use the Google login with your UVA email to visit your existing profile.
